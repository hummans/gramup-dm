We are trying to create a free Direct Messages app for your Instagram. This is not even a early-alpha version now, so please use it for your own risk! This runs only in Desktop Google Chrome and requires our [extension](https://get.gramup.me) to be installed.

## How to use it

Since this project is a part of the [Gram Up!](https://gramup.me/) project, you need to install our [extension](https://get.gramup.me/) for your Google Chrome.

## Credit

New version uses instadm.app frontend with some adaptations and improvements. Check out original project here: https://github.com/JonathanWbn/instadm.app

## Contibution

Feel free to ask any question in our [Telegram Community Chat](https://t.me/instabotproject). If you find some bug or you have a feature request, please write them in [Issues seaction](https://github.com/instagrambot/gramup-dm/issues/new). This would help us to not to forget anything.
